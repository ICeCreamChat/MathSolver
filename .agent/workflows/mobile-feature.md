1. Understand the feature request for Mobile.
2. Reference [vercel-react-native-skills](file:///c:/Users/ICe/.gemini/antigravity/skills/.agents/skills/vercel-react-native-skills/SKILL.md) to plan the implementation:
   - Ensure `SafeAreaView` is used correctly.
   - Plan for Platform-specific differences (iOS vs Android).
   - Use `Pressable` with appropriate hitSlop for touch targets.
3. Generate the code following these mobile-first constraints.
