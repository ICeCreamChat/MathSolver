1. View the current file or generated UI code.
2. Review the design against [web-design-guidelines](file:///c:/Users/ICe/.gemini/antigravity/skills/.agents/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md):
   - **Accessibility**: specific check for contrast ratios, aria-labels, and keyboard navigation.
   - **Responsiveness**: Verify layout behavior on mobile vs desktop.
   - **Visual Hierarchy**: Check spacing, typography, and consistency with Vercel's design aesthetic (if applicable).
3. Suggest specific CSS/Tailwind changes to improve the "Look & Feel" to be more premium.
